    <description>Determines where on the local filesystem an DFS data node
should store its blocks.  If this is a comma-delimited
list of directories, then data will be stored in all named
directories, typically on different devices.
Directories that do not exist are ignored.

This is the default replication factor for each block of data in the
file system. For a production cluster, this should usually be left at
its default value of 3. (You are free to increase your replication
factor, though this may be unnecessary and use more space than is
required. Fewer than three replicas impact the high availability of
information, and possibly the reliability of its storage
